# HW-5-Work-Day-Scheduler

This is a daily planner which can be used to create a schedule

- When the planner is initiated, the current day is displayed.
- The current day is displayed and when scrolled down, you are presented with timeblocks for that day.
- The timeblocks are for standard business day hours (9am to 5pm).
- The timeblocks are color coded to indicate, past, present or future times.
- When I click inside a timeblock, I can enter an event or task to be completed for that hour. 
- When I click the add to calender button, the text for that event is saved in local storage. 
- If the page is refreshed, the saved events will still be shown in the corresponding timeblock.
